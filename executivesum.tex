\chapter{Executive Summary\label{chap:exec}}

The purpose of the executive summary is to explain the main features of your report in a way that will make the reader want to learn more. An executive summary is a brief section at the beginning of a long report, article, recommendation, or proposal that summarizes the document. It is not background and not an introduction. People who read only the executive summary should get the essence of the document without fine details.
